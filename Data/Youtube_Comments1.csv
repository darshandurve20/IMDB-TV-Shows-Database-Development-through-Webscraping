0DAmWHxeoKw,"It was great, Until they started dancing randomly for no reason.
I stopped watching because of it.
Whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be fired."
0DAmWHxeoKw,This looks like absolute shit
0DAmWHxeoKw,Já assisti a série gostei e quro saber se tem mais

rlR4PJn8b8I,"This prayer shall the Saoshyants, Saviours, Chant; and by the chanting of it I shall rule over my creatures. I who am Ahura Mazda (the Lord of Light). Not shall Ahriman have power, Anra Mainyu, o'er my creatures, He (the fiend (the Night King)) of foul religion. 3. In the earth shall Ahriman hide, In the earth, the demons hide. *Up, the dead again shall rise And within their lifeless bodies Incorporate life shall be restored.*

The night king wins... But after he wins, the Lord of light kills him and revives everyone"

I wish Cersie was the 1 living close to white walkers than winterfell. Now that dumb will just sit back & watch. 
In case something like this happens; that the North fights bravely & with a lot of sacrifices, barely defeat white walkers,  & then Cersie decides to take them. I'll just lose it. I will be fuuuuurrrrrious 😠 as f***."
rlR4PJn8b8I,Can't wait for it to start but going to be a sad day when it ends
VQljeqzppjs,I think the little clip from Vietnam at the end symbolizes how he's finally back to his normal self. The decision of marrying his wife is (for the most part) his first choice in life besides going to Vietnam.
VQljeqzppjs,"the worse of all three shows, clunky and without a pace at all....it actually means nothing...and not even the good kind of nothing...it's just Jacobs Ladder across eight episodes..thank god it didn not run for more episodes like the first two.

the first season was a masterpiece (my opinion is they should have stopped there), the second was worse but it was not a bad film, just that everything was too mundane..(but the characters were cool) 

all characters of the first two shows were FUCKED UP...that was their main charm...all were damaged goods....

here it looks that the maker couldn't realy decide how his cahracters should be....and they seem pulled in many directions but go into none...


I get the take on the metaphysical TIME IS A FLAT CIRCLE ..and that everything exists in a single moment, that NOTHING actually happens , and all is a clever concoted illusion...but you don't need eight fucking episodes to express that (however the film does express this point PERFECTLY tho)


the first season expressed that feeling also, but it expanded on the STRUGGLE of human beings within that state...there was ACTUAL DRAMA there ..although drama was not the point....there was emotion , depth of feeling , melancholy.....here there are only shallow attemps at emotions and zero depth...the moments that try to be profound are robbed of depth by a much too shallow and rushed presentation


none of the characters REALLY STRUGGLE..Although the film tries to trick the audience into beliving so...


to sum things up ..you watch eight episodes..only to come to the conclusion that nothing happened...too bad for the great crushing atmosphere...

Jacobs ladder had struggle...this feels half assed low budget to me ...even like a cheap ripoff....almost a waste of time"
VQljeqzppjs,"I don’t know why Roland felt so guilty, that was a justified shooting. I know the beat down or the cover of weren’t but anyways nice break down. Good job."
VQljeqzppjs,So is the ending scene where he’s walking into the jungle supposed to be what was going through his mind as they were walking out of the vfw?
VQljeqzppjs,"So many rating season 3 to season 1. 
Season 1 had many flaws, several stolen cinematic scenes, many goofs in continuity, and useless pieces of info introduced in order to make it look mysterious. Season 1 was also not very good in its story line, or presentation."
_griZYR93oo,"If it is the same with the comics it will be bad for the show,because you know already what will going to happen so they change it for the audience..."
_griZYR93oo,Michael Meyers fan club. Lmfao!

LbvfBECmdyM,"It's shameful when people just say disrespectful comments regarding Debra's experience. Some percent  of people are deceitful, compulsive liars, con artists etc... Sociopath know exactly what to do to manipulate you, gaslight, isolate  and trauma bond. If you have no experience regarding what you go through in such abusive and toxic relationship I suggest, you should avoid commenting such ignorant opinions. I'm personally a survivor of a sociopath. So be kind, everyone is fighting their on battles."
LbvfBECmdyM,donde lo puedo ver subtitulado?
LbvfBECmdyM,The name to this people is psychopath
LbvfBECmdyM,"The documentary is amazing. So is the Netflix series. I say this because I’ve always liked Eric Bana as an actor.  Great performances. And when I saw the series, I wanted to fucking kill him.  Every time he pulled something, I’d start muttering what a lowlife piece of shit scumbag this guy is.  My wife thought it was funny.  I kept wondering how nobody put a bullet in him.  Seriously.  This guy needed to die way before he did.  At the hands of a woman no less. How ironic.  You almost wish he would have survived so you could laugh in his face. Sadly?  There probably isn’t one person that shed a tear that he was killed.  Not one.  Ohh,  and rightly so. Anyone this guy came in contact with was glad he was taken out. In this whole world, not one person gave a shit this cocksucking lowlife was stabbed in the eye and discarded like garbage. So fitting.  Flush the toilet. This turd stunk up the world long enough.  But I’m not fooled for a second.  I know there’s going to be more trash to clean up like him.  And may they all find the same end. I hope."
LbvfBECmdyM,MILF's are so desperate and stupid .... like wtf !!

fGlb2lQOA68,This scene brought me to genuine tears🧡 “there can be 100 people in a room...” *in my Lady GaGa voice*
fGlb2lQOA68,I’m so happy she is leaving
fGlb2lQOA68,I always knew Max was a good guy.
fGlb2lQOA68,"Mann, I wonder if she gives the fam some cash before leaving. I cant believe she is leaving shameless. I hope she comes back for like the final season or even just finale ep. I LOVE Fi so much!"
fGlb2lQOA68,Really thought she'd runaway with Jimmy/steve
YHcKoAMGGvY,Just finished watching this series. Episode 1 was boring at first but the rest was amazing.. go and watch it
YHcKoAMGGvY,"I’m on episode three right now and I’m loving it!! Such a great concept, very realistic :)"
YHcKoAMGGvY,"This show was superb, the writing, the backstory, and the acting! The fact that its so different from what's currently on t.v is what made it even better! Amazing show."
YHcKoAMGGvY,cool so its like groundhog day but less funny
YHcKoAMGGvY,What is the best Netflix original of 2019.
7WQFrVA20vg,"I dont understand people who are too anxious to wait and get to know the characters of a show, come on you need time to care for someone, right? This is why people need to chill and wait until all is said and done, and just then draw some conclusions. Thats one of the reasons i love The Orville, it takes its time to build each character, none of them is as important as the group that they together make, and none of them have all the answers (cof cof im looking at you Micheal Burnham...). God I hope one day Seth gets the chance to direct a Star Trek series, or at least give us 8 more seasons of The Orville jeje"
7WQFrVA20vg,Great review to watch before viewing episode 10...  Thanks fella!
7WQFrVA20vg,"""But... But... Discovery has Michael Burnham! She would've taken down the whole Kaylon fleet with simple plan!"""
7WQFrVA20vg,Have to admit that was one of the better space battles I have seen on television. Or even the movies
7WQFrVA20vg,"I have a new name for this episode: OLD BLUE EYES IS BACK!!!

BTW: I believe Isaac has blue eyes because he was constructed later--so that his ""age"" is immediately known by the color of his eyes."

XM0xWpBYlNM,"Watching this on putlocker, the entire 5 hour thing was the most confusing and frustrating thing I've ever done in my life"
XM0xWpBYlNM,it may be the first one in a new genre but i don't think it was that good in being what it is
XM0xWpBYlNM,Im still thinking about what they’ll do after this one
XM0xWpBYlNM,"Hi, I’m going to watch Black Mirror.. Is it worth my time?"
XM0xWpBYlNM,"This was really good. But I think it would've messed with people's heads more if it would had been slightly different. If they hadn't allowed the viewer to choose the path and if there hadn't been a Netflix spoof scene then viewers wouldn't be connecting the ""spirit out there"" to us. The viewer would've been left on a cliff hanger, not in the film, but on life itself. Because shows such as black mirror and the twilight zone make you second guess reality.  What is real? What is not?"
AqbIrTWTlCU,Damn
AqbIrTWTlCU,"AMAZING , can we have an edit were you use Holy Wars...The Punishment due , after all MEGADETH did that song cause Mustaine is a huger fan of the punisher."
AqbIrTWTlCU,"Really impressed; especially that ending, amazing! Good job! --> Subscribed :)"
AqbIrTWTlCU,this is fucking awesome

tplHcZlgDyk,59:13 was the single funniest thing I’ve ever seen on this show
tplHcZlgDyk,""" A rising to power is most inappropriate to its actual journey, and most often it is your face that is most inappropriate.  That's why we have stock photos, marketing, and pseudonyms in a secret scientific Hell.  Me, I'm really a book hound, a poet, a mathematician, even a physicist, and a ring maker, but I look more like a prince.  I've spent significant time with the Occults and Devilry.  I'm also a schizophrenic.  I've played drums and bass guitar, but...I also am drug-free.  I have a degree in Graphic Design and a lot a machining skills.   Image is everything.  Come see who really runs the world and how.  Your all nothing faces in post. Things are not as they appear, buddy.  Keep that in mind. If there is God you may meet him and find out he's really the Devil.  I'm also German and Spanish, my mother is Brown and worked for CIA intelligence and my father worked with Atomic Weaponry, and I come from the upper-middle class.  My logic simply does not work that way."" -AKA, Vase Basaline"

5sUana1mP_U,Please...... more of Harvey and Donna hot and steamy in season 9!!!
5sUana1mP_U,I've watched this almost an embarassing amount of times.
5sUana1mP_U,And this is why I stopped wearing sweatpants and holey shirts around the house.
5sUana1mP_U,The music used in this scene is just perfect
5sUana1mP_U,But wouldn’t Harvey have been even a little concerned that he would encounter Thomas when he dropped by her apartment unannounced? Just wondering.
GfYp06R1-5E,hated first season and just felt that in season 2 they listen to all my complaint even though i never expressed them publicly BRAVO!
GfYp06R1-5E,The red angel will prove to be Chief O'Brien.
GfYp06R1-5E,its true that the episode with suru death tilly death vision and the dying planet is overcrowded with elements but still a great episode!!!
GfYp06R1-5E,"I have to admit I’m disappointed we have a mid season break, which means their doing a good job if I want to see more.

I’m liking the actor playing pike he is no Jason Isaacs but he is still good, I don’t know how they do it but pike looks old and young at the same time, I still dislike Michael, no we’re near as much as in the first half of season one but she is my least favourite cast member, but every show has to have a most to least favourite list and Michael isn’t Tilly, suru (I’m probably still spelling that wrong) stamus (I’m probably spelling that wrong too) 

I’m actually liking the use of section 31, yes they don’t line up with what we know in DS9 but that’s over 100 years later that’s more than enough time for them to erase them self’s from the history books and everyone alive to forget about them (or be assassinated) heck we have forgotten stuff that happen 20years back and that without a well funded, well equipped and skilled organisation covering it up, so ye I’m fine with it also I think I cheered when the emperoress showed back up for the first time.

Also you mention that there is no subspace but what if their is, what if what ends up been called subspace is actually the mycelial network?"
GfYp06R1-5E,"I think you've nailed the issue that I've been struggling to deal with in watching Discovery. It is a little dense in Plot but that may only require an adjustment in how I watch the show. I've missed the last 3 or 4 episodes, but on hearing of the return of the Talosian's, I had my interest peaked. Watching this video has convinced me that the show deserves another go."

mOJs3DpEBi8,"Can’t wait, Red is back!"
M8KmqaJvgpE,The reason I edited it like this (the scene cutting and finishing later on) is because I felt it would be a really long segment to leave the entire thing at once. I’m sorry if that seemed frustrating but thank you for the feedback!!
M8KmqaJvgpE,Holy shit. When the camera pans to Dwight turning around wearing the CPR dummie’s face while making the silence of the lamb notorious noise. I just about shit myself. Haven’t laughed like that in a while

 I'm sorry.. I cant ..."
gk1vKFcUxyU,"Asian girl totally whore, she wants the white guy and house and accommodation but still a whore,the no lips face can not even put a band aid or do normal stuff around a baby, the lesbian totally a cunt, that psychologist more stupid, selfish, racist than anyone, this is the problem when women wants to be mothers on theirs late 30s or after theirs 40s is impossible to have the same patience with children. The only ones mature are the black lesbian and the CEO in Montreal."
gk1vKFcUxyU,"With all due respect,  these women are so fucking stupid persons, no matter if they are rich or educated. They are annoying, selfish, arrogant, stupid, mediocre, whore, I mean if I have one of this one in the real life, for sure I put a bullet in  her head. Just for been idiots."
gk1vKFcUxyU,"This show isn’t that funny. I was expecting better, and I’m disgusted by it too. These women are duuuumb"
gk1vKFcUxyU,"I gave it a very fair chance. I watched the whole series and the whole thing was terrible. I don’t get offended that easily but this show has girl on hate, almost glorifies abortion when the character had no good reason to want one, 
and it wasn’t funny, I didn’t laugh once. The list of bad things about this show goes on and on most of the main characters are awful and the only one I like gets torn down by nearly everyone around her."

NFRTIMq19bU,What was your favorite season of Criminal Minds?
NFRTIMq19bU,Can someone explain me why it was canceled?🙏🙏🙏I'm from Slovakia and I better understand text than speech
NFRTIMq19bU,For  series for finale bring back the actress Lila for Reid. They had a connection
NFRTIMq19bU,"There comes a time in every show when an end must come. Criminal Minds stayed around for a good long while, a little longer than it probably should have. It deserves a good ending though. I personally got bored and stopped watching somewhere before season 10 I think and moved onto something else. There are a lot of shows out there that were canceled that deserved at least a few more seasons. 'Forever' is certainly one of them because it wasn't a typical plot and there was an interesting storyline behind it ... but that's just my personal pick out of many."
NFRTIMq19bU,What?! Nooooooo!

Jaden Smith’s Just Water company is working to provide cleaner water for Flint, Michigan, where residents are still routinely waiting in lines that stretch as far as eight blocks for potable water.

Smith’s company teamed up with the First Trinity Missionary Baptist Church and other organizations, including The Last Kilometer, Rethink H2O, Black Millennials for Flint, and 501CTHREE, to announce on March 1 that they’ll be rolling out a mobile filtration system called “The Water Box” to remove lead and other poisons from the contaminated water in Flint.
In the past, the church has provided 5 million bottles of water to the residents of Flint, according to USA Today, but the city has seen a recent decline in donations. The church will provide water from The Water Box on Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m. to residents who bring their own containers. 

According to CNN, Governor Rick Snyder announced the end to Flint’s free bottled water program on April 6, 2018, declaring the water clean. Residents and scientists disagree."

8X5gXIQmY-E,Should I even bother starting season 3? Will I just get mad when it ends since its canceled?
8X5gXIQmY-E,Heard it's good. I'm a science fiction fan. Saw it popped up on my prime video
8X5gXIQmY-E,"Good news, Amazon is picking it the forth season."
8X5gXIQmY-E,I tried to watch this but the first episode was awful.

hRIRAMpmi74,Lucifer can kiss my ass
hRIRAMpmi74,Haha make sure to follow this man @s8n on twitter he gotta get verified
hRIRAMpmi74,Makes you think that you thought the devil was this bad angel that rebelled against god but in reality god had fucked Lucifer up to a point where he’s this cynical and lord of darkness but in fact he’s actually sometimes nice... like an angel...
hRIRAMpmi74,"I love it, but Lucifer is Lucifer"
hRIRAMpmi74,Love how all the 'bad guys' say 'oh god' when the devil is trying to kick their ass. Like thats gonna help
QP1nNpwJJGA,Does anybody know how long Grant Gustin's contract for the Flash is supposed to last?
QP1nNpwJJGA,🎯🎯🎯🎯🏹🏹NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭....I know all great things must come 2 an end still sucks tho!!
QP1nNpwJJGA,I had said after the crossover that the show was going to end with the next season being the last. Back in the day shows went for max 7-8 seasons so this seems very normal to me. Maybe the theory of Oliver sacrificing himself in the next crossover isn't so far fetched.
QP1nNpwJJGA,Say it ain't so.
QP1nNpwJJGA,That means he is sacrificing himself instead of killing barry and kara OMG

pXwlW6M5SvY,Brasil
pXwlW6M5SvY,I want Katherine and Eddie to be together so bad! I can't stand Delilah at all. And her and Eddie are awful together. Katherine and Eddie have more chemistry. Part of me is praying the baby isn't Eddie's but we know it is
pXwlW6M5SvY,I have no words for  the amount of emotions this finale left me with. Closure with John. Hope for Gary and Maggie. Delilah having the baby. Heart stopping with Katherine. And of course Rome and Gina. They aren't going to survive this.
pXwlW6M5SvY,Rome needs to divorce his wife and find somebody who wants have kid's and understand him a lot more.
pXwlW6M5SvY,At first I couldn’t stand Katherine or Eddie but man I’m so team Eddie and Katherine.. I need them to get back together. season 2 hurry up please. 😭
3QgT1X01HyQ,DAMN the Production

DpU1boFhQ74,Isn't that Will Sasso? The lemon vine guy?
DpU1boFhQ74,What season is this
DpU1boFhQ74,It's very strange how people are more angry at the fact she is a snob rather than the fact her father is an serial seducer incest creeper. You really learn what people truly value when you read certain posts
DpU1boFhQ74,The smirk on that girl's face at the end kind of remind me of someone I know who is really into music.  She has arrogant attitude and really look down on people who are not into music the same way she is.  Really sickening.
DpU1boFhQ74,Does the mother also acted in the other episode cuz i remember it was in season 17
1tma522JDdU,TRUMP FOREVER! BUILD THAT WALL! Greeetings from Germany
1tma522JDdU,Mrs.Secretary is such a liar.
1tma522JDdU,TRUMP/PENCE 2020  BUILD THE WALL!
1tma522JDdU,"You are, Spot On Mr. McCall it all points back to The Congress .. The motivation, of a Republican ruling House is in the American people's face as Pure Laziness to Not do their job... Now with, a Democrat ruling House motivation is to try to Block any type of Barrier that would at least Stop or slow down Illegal Alien Invaders crossing the Southern Borders ... It all boils, down to a #1 Priority/ Agenda to ensure much needed VOTES to keep them in POWER for decades to come .. It's Common Knowledge, they have Lost a Large Percentage of the Black and Legal Hispanics Votes across America .. Now to, be fearfully Desperate and do anything to Save their Crumbling Corrupted Party .."

oUJoUVou4-U,Laurel defo ghosted them!!!
oUJoUVou4-U,We need a season 6!
oUJoUVou4-U,WE NEED A SEASON 6 ASAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
oUJoUVou4-U,"This show has became such trash 😂😂😂😂. I remember when everybody was raving about it during seasons 1/2. Killing off Wes was the downfall and nobody gives a shit about this boring whore Laurel (no offense to the real actress) and her stupid family. This Gabriel plot makes no sense at all, he's a talentless replacement for Alfie Enoch (the GOAT). Nate basically has no job and is boring as fuck just Annalise's little pet and fuckbuddy. Frank is useless as well as well as Keating 4. Nobody gives a shit about Oliver, I wish Connor would turn back into the messy gay queen that he used to be. Michaela and asher have zero character development. Honestly if it weren't for Annalise and Bonnie I would have quitted."
oUJoUVou4-U,SEASON 6 PLEASE ABC!!🙏🏽😭
90-Ze-ZHnU0,"Kate ,a boner in any movie👊👊👊👊👊"
90-Ze-ZHnU0,Not enough leather.
90-Ze-ZHnU0,"So from this trailer: A married white chick searches for her husband that left her because she was depressed. She finds him, a bunch of random shit happens in between, the end, NEXT!"
90-Ze-ZHnU0,"So basically this is lost from Penny’s perspectives, looking for Desmond? Dam island."
90-Ze-ZHnU0,"felt in love with her ever since underworld came out.. shes so pretty 
Still look the same"
a8A9xc8l-lk,Grace is so pretty
a8A9xc8l-lk,😍😍
a8A9xc8l-lk,I understand how Danny feels my dad was just in a severe car accident it's scary to think that you've lost someone like that
a8A9xc8l-lk,As a expert detective he should’ve known something was up when she called him “daddy”. She calls him Danno or dad. Never daddy.
a8A9xc8l-lk,i hope s9 will get released soon !!
